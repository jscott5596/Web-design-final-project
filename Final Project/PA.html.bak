<p>Second place isn't often a source of pride, but for King's Island there is no shame in only being the second best amusement park in Ohio. It is hard to surpass Cedar Point, yet King's Island comes really close. Taking up an astounding 364 acres, King's Island is a truly massive amusement park that has something for everyone. Whether its the person who wants a thrill from a roller coaster, or someone who wants to get their feet wet at the water park, or a young kid, King's Island is certain to cover all bases.</p>
<h3>Eden Park </h3>

<p>Eden Park is less of a park and more of a combination of attractions, including: The Cincinnati Art Museum, Krohn Observatory, and Elsinore Arch. Those attractions alone warrant their own place on her, however, Eden park also has park aspects too. Take the twin lakes area, its scenic beauty and pristine waters are where the park got its name (After the biblical garden of Eden).  </p>
<h3>The Cincinnati Zoo & Biotannical Gardens </h3>

<p>Opened in 1878, the Cincinnati zoo features an incredible 500 species (1800 individual animals). If you just broadly like animals you will certainly have a blast here. Whether it be hippos, gorillas, or kangaroos the zoo has nearly every species of animal you can think of. Even if it doesn't it certainly will in the near future, since they add new attractions all of the time.</p>
<h3> Winton Woods </h3>
