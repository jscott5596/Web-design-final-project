<p>The home of the bengals, aswell as the unofficial largest concert venue in Cincinnati, Paycor stadium has become one of Cincinnati's most identifable landmarks. Prior to the 2022 season, the stadium was named after the legendary founder of both the Bengals and Browns-Paul Brown. The stadium currently has a seating capacity of just north of 65,000 seats, though in recent years the Bengals have used over flow seating to adjust to the increasing crowd. Nicknamed "the jungle", you will certainly find a loyal and roaring crowd no matter the time of year or event.</p>
